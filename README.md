# Lucent Heart Network Protocol
This project provides a (working) reverse code engineered version of the network protocol used by the game Lucent Heart (version 2012).

## Analysis
This code has been RCEed only for analysis and research purposes. It has no real application though it could be used in an emulator of the server binaries of the game. The code is strictly faithful to its original version (~2012).

## Project Status
This project is dead (last update in 2012) and will no longer be developed by its author. Please feel free to fork and continue its development.
